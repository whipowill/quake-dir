// DISCUSSION OF WEAPON DPS
// -------------------------
// I've spent a lot of time... a LOT of time... messing w/ custom weapon settings.
// The movement speed and weapons pacing is where the game happens.
// I've learned that "balanced" weapons aren't really fun, bc you never gain dominance.
// You want to pickup certain weapons and feel like something changed, you're the boss now.
// My Q1 settings file is meant to move things in a better direction, but not feel like a different game.
// My Q2 settings file is where I play the game right now, give me a Railgun and a Shotty w/ punch.
// According to the spreadsheet, the avg dps of Q2 weapons is 30% less than the avg dps of Q1.

// See my spreadsheet nerding out on DPS calculations:

// DISCUSSION OF MOVEMENT SPEED
// -----------------------------
// Ultimately this is the biggest choice, how fast do you move?
// My view is Doom/Quake was way way way too fast, 320 is default but 200-240 is the strike zone.
// 240 is fast (pretty fast, can still make all trick jumps, no melee)
// 220 is medium (probably best option, can make some trick jumps, some melee)
// 200 is slow (Halo-style, moving like a snail, melee all the time)
// FPS games from the 90s were too fast paced, slowing it down is funner.
// I want you to move slow enough to make peaking corners, slinging axes, and tossing grenades viable options.

// movement speed
sv_maxspeed 240 // default 320 (100%), 288 (90%), 256 (80%), 240 (75%), 224 (70%), 208 (65%), 192 (60%)
