# Settings

The Scarlet mod allows for customizing the game in some interesting ways.  Included in this folder are some files where I experiment with different play settings.

## Philosophy

This is an attempt to preserve an FPS classic by making it a little better. In a world were real live players have moved on, I wanted to capture the multiplayer experience of the past.

My vision of Quake is a slower FPS than what you remember. It's not a flight simulator, it's a combat simulator. By slowing it down, dangers around you become more life threatening, and you play defensively.

Boosting the effectiveness of weapons (and getting rid of the crummy ones) keeps the game from being a rocket-fest. Taking cues from Quake 2 and Halo 1, slowing rate-of-fire forces you to make more choices.

Finally, I added melee attack and hand grenades. What's the point of having an axe on your back if you never use it? Why charge into the next room when you can throw a grenade instead? Changes everything.

In the end, it's not a question of what I want in the game â€” it's a question of what you want. This mod unlocks the game, everything becomes customizable, giving you control.

What [Brutal](https://brutal-doom.com/) is for singleplayer Doom, I want Scarlet to be for multiplayer Quake. More blood, more gore, more guts, and maybe a little more glory than it had before.
