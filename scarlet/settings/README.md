# Settings

The Scarlet mod allows for customizing the game in some interesting ways.  Included in this folder are some files where I experiment with different play settings.

## Philosophy

I wanted to hit the brakes on FPS games from the 90s and slow it all down.  By moving slower, dangers around you are more life threatening.  It forces you play defensively.  In addition to slowing movement, I slowed rate of fire.  Everything is 25% slower.

I boosted the effectiveness of all the weapons, so the game isn't a rocket-fest.  I made the Thunderbolt like the Railgun from Quake2, the Perferator like the Chaingun from Quake2, and the Super Shotgun like it was in Doom.  I'm trying to find balance.
