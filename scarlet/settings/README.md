# Settings

The Scarlet mod allows for customizing the game in some interesting ways.  Included in this folder are some files where I experiment with different play settings.

## Philosophy

I wanted to hit the brakes on FPS games from the 90s and slow it all down.  By moving slower, the dangers around you are more life threatening.  It forces you to think like a combat soldier and play defensively.  In addition to slowing movement speed, I slowed rate of fire.  Everything is 25% slower.

I boosted the effectiveness of all the weapons, so the game isn't always a rocket-fest.  I made the Thunderbolt behave like the Railgun from Quake2, the Perferator behave like the Assault Rifle from Halo, and the Super Shotgun behave like it was in Doom.  I'm really happy w/ the balance of these settings, it feels perfect.

## Weapon Zoom

Note that my ``autoexec.cfg`` file includes this little gem of code:

```
alias zoom "fov 60; bind mouse2 unzoom"
alias unzoom "fov 90; bind mouse2 zoom"
bind mouse2 zoom
```

This allows me to zoom in on enemies from afar, which is handy for the Railgun.
